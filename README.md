# steganosaurus
Steganosaurus is a program to encipher a plain text message into an image.

Currently, the input text must be in a format which can be converted to ASCII values. The program can only use PNG filetypes as an image template, as JPEGs are subject to a compression algorithm (which interferes with this implementation) and other filetype intracacies are not yet accounted for.
